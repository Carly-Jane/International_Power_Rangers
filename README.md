- What are the most commonly used power sources globaly?
- # Compare developing nations vs a developed nations energy production on output and renuable percentage. 
- Do developing or developed nations produce more power *per capita*?
- Do developing or developed nations use more renewable or non renewable energy sources?
- Bonus: compare COP26 agreements
- Google API plot energy plants


#COP26 agreements, counties agreements vs what power they use. - Need to find COP26 data source

# Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows.

* [ ] Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**

* [ ] Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)

* [ ] Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation

* [ ] Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions

* [ ] Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
