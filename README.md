## Name/Title: Who is the real power house? 

### An explorative analysis of global energy production by Nick, Mike, Aline & Carly

### Topic Elaboration:
Itâ€™s a power-hungry world that we live in. Everyone needs it to live but how do we make it? 
The answer is powerplants, and lots of them! 

In this analysis we will deep dive into how the world produces its power. who produces the most and who is the cleanest, we will see how developed countries stack up against developing in their production and their sustainability


#### Data Type: International Energy Sector
* Base Data Source: https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase

* 2nd Data Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD 
* 2nd Data Source further info: UN classifications for bins: https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/wesp_current/2014wesp_country_classification.pdf

* 3rd Data Source: https://github.com/COP26-Hackathon/Met-Office-Climate-Data-Challenge-March_2021/wiki/Data-Sources 
* 3rd Data Source COP 26 further info: https://www.sustainalytics.com/cop26


## Main Questions:

  * What are the most commonly used power sources globaly?
  * Do developing or developed nations produce more power per capita?
  * Do developing or developed nations use more renewable or non renewable energy sources?
  * Bonus: compare COP26 agreements
  * Google API plot energy plants

### Possible considerations:
COP26 agreements, counties agreements vs what power they use. - Need to find COP26 data source
Compare renewable energy output with non renewable output.
Compare renewable energy outputs within the renewable sector.
