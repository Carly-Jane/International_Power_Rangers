## Main Questions:

  * What are the most commonly used power sources globaly?
  * Do developing or developed nations produce more power per capita?
  * Do developing or developed nations use more renewable or non renewable energy sources?
  * Bonus: compare COP26 agreements
  * Google API plot energy plants

Possible considerations:
COP26 agreements, counties agreements vs what power they use. - Need to find COP26 data source
Compare renewable energy output with non renewable output.
Compare renewable energy outputs within the renewable sector.
